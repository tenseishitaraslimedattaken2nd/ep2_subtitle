1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,340
The delegation from the
Animal Kingdom of Eurazania,

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,800
sent by the Demon Lord
Carrion, arrived in Tempest.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,110
But the moment they did,
some things happened...

4
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,980
And this is what it devolved into.

5
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,300
I mean, it is kind of my fault... I guess?

6
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,320
That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime

7
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,360
Episode 26: Trade with the Animal Kingdom

8
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,410
Is that all the strength a Kijin has?

9
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,750
You can entertain me a lot more than that!

10
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,880
That was my intent all along.

11
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,890
Prepare yourself!

12
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,180
That's...

13
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,680
A maximum Magic Bullet?!

14
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,050
H-Hey, Shion, hang on a second!

15
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,190
Do you wanna blow this
entire area to bits?!

16
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,690
Oh, jeez! She's not listening!

17
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,200
Ooh, nice! Bring it on!

18
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,460
And that Suphia lady is
dead set on taking it!

19
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,510
Will there even be anything left
of her if that thing hits her?!

20
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,260
What do I do? Stop her?

21
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,160
Here it comes!

22
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,000
Stop!

23
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,860
That is enough.

24
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,090
Beast transformation, huh?

25
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,850
Let us end this here.

26
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,460
So what's the verdict? Do we pass?

27
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,100
Yes.

28
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,220
We're done here.

29
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,150
Huh?

30
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,620
Er, Master, does this mean...

31
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,610
It looks like they were testing us.

32
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,630
No complaints here.
Your might is impressive.

33
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,190
There'll be plenty of value for us
in associating with you as equals.

34
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,790
I'm convinced of that now.

35
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,550
To underestimate the leader of
the Jura Tempest Federation,

36
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,490
Rimuru Tempest, and his companions

37
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,030
should be considered an
insult to Lord Carrion!

38
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,990
Got it?

39
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,550
Yes, ma'am!

40
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,620
Lady Suphia is right.

41
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,100
There aren't many humans who
can keep up with me so well.

42
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,390
Glad to hear that.

43
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,560
They had me worried, and so
soon after they arrived here...

44
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,810
I'm glad it all worked out nicely.

45
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,030
Shion, you get it now, right?

46
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,180
Shion?

47
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,270
Um...

48
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,340
What do I do with this?

49
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,460
Crap! It's about to blow!

50
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,830
C-Can't you get rid of it?!

51
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,290
No, I can't! My energy is at its limit!

52
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,380
Great Rimuru, we must take shelter.

53
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,110
J-Just calm down!

54
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,420
Gently... Gently aim that thing upward!

55
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,240
U-Upward?

56
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,590
Force it if you have to! Just do it!

57
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,680
I-I don't think I can!

58
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,280
Honestly, Shion, you're hopeless.

59
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,940
Shion, fire it at me!

60
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,440
Don't worry.

61
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,440
But...

62
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,510
Trust me!

63
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,700
O-Okay! Here it comes!

64
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,620
Gluttony!

65
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,630
There, all done.

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,890
It can't be...

67
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,760
Are you kidding me?

68
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,020
That much is only natural
to expect from my master.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,520
Are you all right?

70
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,720
I can see why Lord Carrion approves of you.

71
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,280
We are grateful that our nation has
established relations with yours.

72
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,860
Likewise.

73
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,570
Welcome to Tempest!

74
00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,010
Thus we welcomed the
delegation from Eurazania.

75
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,420
That night,

76
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,970
a little welcome party was held in the
reception hall we had just completed.

77
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,640
This is good!

78
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,500
The flavoring is fantastic.

79
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,940
It's just salty enough, too.

80
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,140
I could eat this forever!

81
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,280
Delicious!

82
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,700
What bliss.

83
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,490
She's quite the drinker.

84
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,040
Who the heck gave her entire barrels?

85
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,790
And over here...

86
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,640
Hey, are you sure you should let
strangers see you doing that?

87
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,460
It isn't particularly a secret.

88
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,720
R-Really?

89
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,210
But...

90
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,730
it is a side I only show to those I trust.

91
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,750
I see. Well, okay, then.

92
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,230
Still, though...

93
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,820
I can't believe you drank all
of the apple brandy alone.

94
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,440
All of it?

95
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,110
You don't make very much?

96
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,920
Oh, sorry. Don't worry about it.

97
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,170
Of course, it's something we
make specially for guests,

98
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,550
but we rely on the bounty
of the forest for our fruit,

99
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,210
so we can't pick very much.

100
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,710
In that case, I have a good idea.

101
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,910
Fruit is abundant in Eurazania.

102
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,510
I can arrange to have some sent here.

103
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,270
What? Really?

104
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,520
Of course.

105
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,140
Isn't that wonderful, Great Rimuru?

106
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,120
Yeah!

107
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
I see.

108
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,910
That's a "so give us your
country's booze," isn't it?

109
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,870
In what ratio?

110
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,440
We'll trust you to work out the details.

111
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,040
I'm happy as long as I can drink good liquor.

112
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,470
Eurazania's fruit is top-quality,
so you can expect the best!

113
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,760
Hmm...

114
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,040
Leaving the mundane stuff to us, huh?

115
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,710
How much would make it an equal trade?

116
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,730
Okay. I'll let a specialist handle this.

117
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,840
Shuna!

118
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,230
Yes, Great Rimuru?

119
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,420
Go get Koby for me.

120
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,570
He's a Kobold merchant.

121
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:36,240
Kobold Merchant  Koby

122
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,660
He's running a shop in Tempest now,

123
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,240
and he manages all of our merchants.

124
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,130
G-Great Rimuru, what is this about?

125
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,920
This is Koby-chan.
He represents all our merchants.

126
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,620
He's also done business
in Demon Lord domains,

127
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,830
so I'm putting him in charge of our trade.

128
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,670
Huh?!

129
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,070
These folks are from the Animal Kingdom.

130
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,420
If there's anything besides the liquor
that you're interested in, negotiate away.

131
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,360
Wait, wait, wait! Weaker races aren't
allowed in the Animal Kingdom!

132
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,640
We'll make sure to get you
clearance. Don't be shy.

133
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,180
And we will inform Lord Carrion in advance.

134
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,950
You're not all that different
from the Lycanthropes.

135
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,980
You'll get on fine.

136
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,480
What?!

137
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,580
So it's settled. Thanks!

138
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,740
Um, er... All right...

139
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,610
Well, I'll leave you young folks to it, then.

140
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,990
Please excuse us.

141
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,750
Huh?! Wha... Wait!

142
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,000
Great Rimuru!

143
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,170
We can rest easy with Koby-chan handling it.

144
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,760
Yes, you're right.

145
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:39,670
Negotiations always go more
smoothly over drinks, too.

146
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,360
And so the night wore on.

147
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,220
Not a bad start to our
relations with foreign lands!

148
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,240
A few days later, Albis and
Suphia returned to Eurazania.

149
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,200
Our nations plan to share
our skills, as well.

150
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:07,830
These folks stayed behind in Tempest
to learn some of our techniques.

151
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,730
They're all diligent and good-natured.

152
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,830
How do you get hot water to come out
of this thing you call a "faucet"?

153
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,060
You don't seem to be boiling it anywhere.

154
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,310
It's rune magic.

155
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,810
Rune magic?

156
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,140
Where are the runes?

157
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:35,880
There's a magicrystal with a heat magic
rune on it built into the handle.

158
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,580
I see!

159
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,620
So if anyone with magic turns
it, the water is heated!

160
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,330
Dwarf artisans really know their stuff!

161
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,330
Aw, this isn't such a big deal.

162
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,830
Plus it was actually Rimuru's idea...

163
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,330
To be precise, it was Great Sage's idea.

164
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,370
You're not gonna observe the artisans
like the rest of your people?

165
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,800
Nah, not me.

166
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,640
Sir Phobio, the Black Leopard Fang,
who's in confinement now,

167
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,970
ordered me to be useful to Great Rimuru.

168
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,810
That's why you're hanging
out with the town guard?

169
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,410
That's right.

170
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,230
Hey, Grucius!

171
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,960
We're going on patrol.

172
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,840
Got it.

173
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,110
Later.

174
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,760
Well, guess I'll hop in
the bath or something...

175
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,840
You will train with the sword.

176
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,740
Yes, sir.

177
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,170
For dividing fractions, looking
at it this way is a bit difficult,

178
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,580
so we'll try converting them
to multiplication problems.

179
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,520
To convert division problems
to multiplication problems,

180
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,180
They're still studying even without me here.

181
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,450
you swap the numerator and
denominator on the right side.

182
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,470
We call this the inverse.

183
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,560
When you multiply the inverse with the
original number, the answer is always...

184
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,900
Then a few more days passed...

185
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,900
and Youm's gang set out to further
spread their reputation as champions.

186
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,150
They just missed the return of
our delegation led by Benimaru.

187
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:10,910
Eurazania's knights are as
remarkable as you would expect.

188
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:16,040
Every last knight was painstakingly
trained by Demon Lord Carrion himself.

189
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,740
I can see why they call him the Beastmaster.

190
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,550
Anything else?

191
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,940
Yes. The buildings there are quite
crude compared to Tempest's.

192
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,560
But the royal palace is highly extravagant.

193
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,180
It's very clear that the
wealth is concentrated there.

194
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,610
Rigur has grown into such a fine man!

195
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,750
Uh...

196
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,820
But I don't mean that in a bad way.

197
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,060
It's what the kingdom's citizens want.

198
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,220
I see.

199
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,440
And it's not just the architecture.

200
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,240
Their craftsmanship, among other
things, is also inferior to ours.

201
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,350
Yeah, because we have not
only Kaijin and his buddies,

202
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,560
but Kurobe and Shuna, too.

203
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,800
But there was just one thing
I found absolutely incredible.

204
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,630
What was it?

205
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,260
Their agriculture.

206
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,580
Oh!

207
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,350
Their vast fields are unlike
anything we have here in Tempest,

208
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,350
and they grow a brilliant
array of produce in abundance.

209
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,890
Do you think we can learn their techniques?

210
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:19,900
I think it's possible.

211
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,050
All right!

212
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,150
We'll have our next delegation focus
on checking out their agriculture!

213
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,130
We have improved our food situation
significantly as it is,

214
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,740
but in some areas, we are still
in a stage of trial and error.

215
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,610
This may be helpful in
improving those areas...

216
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,880
Rigur has grown into such a fine man!

217
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,290
Okay, I need to get ready to
head for the Dwarf Kingdom,

218
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,010
so you guys can handle the rest.

219
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,320
I'm counting on you all.

220
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,150
Right!

221
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,670
Great Rimuru.

222
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,370
If you will allow it,

223
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,450
would it be all right to make Rigur
the head of the delegation henceforth?

224
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,820
What's this about?

225
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,750
I have determined that Demon
Lord Carrion can be trusted.

226
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,080
There is no concern that he
will treat our envoys poorly.

227
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,530
That being the case, I feel I should
remain here to defend our nation.

228
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,160
Hmm... And you think Rigur can
be entrusted to take over.

229
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,770
That's what you're saying?

230
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,410
Yes.

231
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,820
Okay, sounds good.

232
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,190
Thank you.

233
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,680
But if you really trust him that much,

234
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,810
I guess Carrion rules with
more than just strength, huh?

235
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,450
Indeed.

236
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,730
The truth is, I tried
picking a fight with him,

237
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,060
and he laughed at me.

238
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,570
Huh?!

239
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,570
Y-Y-You actually...

240
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,520
I couldn't use Hell Flare, of course,

241
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,820
so I lost spectacularly.

242
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,540
I still have much to learn.

243
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,660
You're so...

244
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,550
Oh, but I did defeat Phobio.

245
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,580
I see...

246
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,420
I mean, it's amazing that
you beat Phobio, but...

247
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,120
Yeah, no! He's definitely a guy I shouldn't
have allowed outside this country!

248
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,850
So all of that happened, but...

249
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,100
The next day,

250
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,080
it was my turn to set off for Dwargon.

251
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,230
Hey, Ranga! Too fast!

252
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,690
Understood, Master!

253
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,500
Ranga!

254
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:35,870
This time, I was accompanied by six
Goblin Riders, including Gobta and Gobzo...

255
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,560
Shuna and Shion...

256
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:43,390
and Kaijin, along with the Dwarf
brothers, Garm, Dord, and Myrd.

257
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,430
It'll be real nice to take
it easy in Dwargon again.

258
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,050
I sure do appreciate this.

259
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,100
You said it! Right, you guys?

260
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,620
Absolutely!

261
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,170
I'm glad to hear you guys say that, too.

262
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,900
Our nation has come so far
thanks to your help, after all.

263
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:06,610
Hearing you say that makes me
feel blessed to be a craftsman.

264
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:07,320
Yeah.

265
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,570
I'm truly glad I met all of you.

266
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,570
Aw, gee...

267
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,040
By the way, the two carriages behind us

268
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,380
are loaded with gifts for King Gazel.

269
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,280
And if you're thinking
it would've been easier

270
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,080
to carry them in my stomach
than load them in carriages...

271
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,840
Formality is important
in matters such as these.

272
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,520
...is what I was told.

273
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,240
That's an Ogre princess for you.

274
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,780
She's been learning a lot from Vesta lately,

275
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,250
so I can count on her when it comes
to things like etiquette, too.

276
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,380
And I thought Shion would be

277
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,480
an even worse candidate to let outside
the country than Benimaru, but...

278
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,350
What?

279
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,230
Princess Shuna is going
on a vacation with you?

280
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,770
No, it's business, not a vacation...

281
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,480
That's not fair! Not fair at all!

282
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,720
Why does only Princess Shuna
get to have fun with you?!

283
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,610
It's business! Business!

284
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,110
Lady Shion, please relax!

285
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,070
Just calm down!

286
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,210
So she cried, she screamed,
she threw a fit...

287
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,300
Can I leave things to you, Rigurd?

288
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,050
Th-This is... n-nothing...

289
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:19,490
I felt bad leaving her with
Rigurd and the others,

290
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,570
so I agreed to take her along.

291
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,250
Of course, when she's quiet,
she looks like a capable lady.

292
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,630
As long as I keep an eye on her,
it shouldn't end in disaster.

293
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,210
Great Rimuru, look.

294
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,570
The road that was destroyed in
the battle against Charybdis

295
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,680
is almost completely cleaned up.

296
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,310
Hey, you're right. They work fast.

297
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,240
Geld and his comrades never cease to impress.

298
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,710
Good. We're on schedule.

299
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,800
Sir Geld, we'll need to place
an order for more stones.

300
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,870
Very well.

301
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,720
I'll send word to the quarry.

302
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,510
Thank you.

303
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,510
Isn't that...

304
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,190
This was the day of your departure
for the Dwarf Kingdom?

305
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,060
Yeah.

306
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,610
With the road laid so well,
it's been a smooth, easy ride.

307
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,700
Yes, we've been working from the
direction of the Dwarf Kingdom,

308
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,830
so the rest of the road from
this point forward is finished.

309
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,820
Oh? Sounds like it'll be an
even nicer ride from here.

310
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,830
Good work!

311
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,920
Thank you.

312
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:31,900
So...

313
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,510
What is this?

314
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,970
Beer.

315
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,800
Beer?!

316
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,820
Don't drink too much, though!

317
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,810
Thank you, Great Rimuru!

318
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,030
Yes, sir!

319
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,810
And so our journey continued smoothly...

320
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,320
and four days after our departure,

321
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,840
we arrived in the nation of Dwargon.

322
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,990
Gate opening!

323
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,920
Look at those fine magical
beasts pulling their carriages.

324
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,260
Are these people that important?

325
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,780
Those are magical beasts?
I've never seen any before.

326
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,580
The way those carriages
are made is unusual...

327
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,440
Hey, Bro.

328
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,360
Glad to see you're looking so well.

329
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,650
Kaido, it's you!

330
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,660
It's been so long! How've you been?

331
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,400
I've been having a great
time working for Rimuru.

332
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,640
I bet. I can tell from the look on your face.

333
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,140
You guys been doing good, too, Garm?

334
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,900
Yep, thanks for asking.

335
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,760
Sure have.

336
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,430
So... where's Rimuru, anyway?

337
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,460
Huh?

338
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,160
He's a guest of the state, you know.

339
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,760
I need to give him a proper welcome.

340
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,690
What's he talking about? I'm right here...

341
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,320
Oh, right. He only knows my slime form.

342
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,830
This is Rimuru.

343
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,860
Huh?

344
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,080
This is Rimuru.

345
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,120
Eh?

346
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,370
This is him.

347
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:51,960
Wha?

348
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,170
What?!

349
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,650
Yeah, some stuff happened...

350
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,220
R-Rimuru... sir... you look well,
and that's all that matters.

351
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,650
Um... well, then, right this way.

352
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,800
Yeah, I can't blame him.

353
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,770
And so we arrived safely in Dwargon

354
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,840
and had our audience with
King Gazel right away.

355
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,280
I'm glad to see you're
in good health, Rimuru.

356
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,780
Same to you, Dorf-dono.

357
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,520
Please, no need for formalities with me.

358
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,730
Now, our king awaits you.

359
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,450
Dorf is the captain of the Pegasus Knights,

360
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,420
who helped us in the
battle against Charybdis.

361
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,060
The Pegasus Knights are a top-secret
force in direct service to the king,

362
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,420
so they normally present themselves as
regular civil servants, just like this.

363
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,410
The ruler of the Jura Tempest Federation,

364
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,870
His Majesty Rimuru, has arrived.

365
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,090
Please, go on inside.

366
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,880
The king of the Armed Nation of Dwargon,

367
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,370
Gazel Dwargo.

368
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,870
It's been some time, Rimuru.

369
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,900
I see.

370
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,780
Well done.

371
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,460
This is quite the intriguing report.

372
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,760
Thank you.

373
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,110
I would gladly return
your heart to you now...

374
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,240
but if you would do just
one more little job for me,

375
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,710
it would be a tremendous help.

376
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,240
What would you like me to do, Lord Clayman?

377
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,780
Oh, it's a simple thing, really.

378
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,500
Very, very simple.

379
00:21:59,030 --> 00:21:59,940
Understand,

380
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,540
Myulan?

381
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,390
Next time, "Paradise, Once More."

382
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,020
Paradise, Once More
